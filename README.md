# 🔎Simple Python Port Scanner

This is a **basic Python port scanner** I created while learning **Networking and Python automation**.  
The purpose of this project is **educational only** — to practice how port scanning works and to understand open ports in a safe environment.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Scan a target IP address or hostname.
- Check if specific ports are **open** or **closed**.
- Learn how attackers might scan for open ports (but used here for **defensive learning**).
